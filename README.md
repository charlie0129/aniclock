A clock with anime girls holding digits, useful for desktop widgets.

Basically it looks like this:

<p align="center" style="image-rendering: pixelated;">
  <img src="readme-assets/example.gif" />
</p>
> Some jagged lines are due to gif downscaling. It will not be present in the actual image.

## Possible use case

I personally use it as a desktop widget with [Plash (macOS only)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Plash):

<p align="center" style="image-rendering: pixelated;">
  <img src="readme-assets/macos-widget.gif" />
</p>



- Double click hours to change style
- Double click minutes to show/hide seconds
- Drag to move around
- Position, size, and visibility of seconds are preserved between reloads
